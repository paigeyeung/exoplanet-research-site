## Latest Update (February 1, 2021)

For groups that are writing papers, the paper guidelines can be found [here](/papers/). When you have completed your draft, it will be reviewed by your point person and Kalee (in that order) before it is sent to astronomers. The first papers from this workshop will be coming out soon!

The notebook that is updated to reflect new updates as of 02/01 can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kvuzjlFpR3FD5HV9XoGC6yJQxtmBwkbD?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. (Note that if you get an error on the final cell, EXOTIC ran into an error and output files were not generated.) We are working on a new version of the transit submission notebook.

<!-- You can clone an old version of [this repository](https://github.com/rzellem/exotic){:target="_blank"} using Git (tutorial [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12256137/cloning-an-older-version-of-github-repo){:target="_blank"}, or feel free to message Paige for assistance). The [transit submission notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C4n-FMeb9v675ScZnBa_dQZpzGlxMbBb?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} for the 8/22 version of EXOTIC is here. -->

<!-- You can also try running EXOTIC locally or on this [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1W1vrgEp9_IjEN16WFxmopLDYvHeYfxpw){:target="_blank"} linked in the EXOTIC repository if you are still running transits or would like to rerun any transits you've run before. If you run the latest version of EXOTIC on your device, it should run much faster now. -->

As always, please feel free to reach out to your point person for any guidance you need. We encourage you to schedule small group meetings to discuss the project and work on tasks within your groups.

## The Workshop

The Exoplanet Research Workshop is a group-led project intended to bring the [astronomy research seminar](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AAS...23212207G/abstract){:target="_blank"} experience to a larger population of (primarily) high school students. Workshop participants contribute research findings to [NASA's Exoplanet Watch](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/about-exoplanet-watch/), a citizen science initative.

We've shared our workshop experiences and citizen science research with the larger space science, citizen science, and science education community at the [Global Hands-On Universe Conference](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=949654105549090&t=1720){:target="_blank"} and will be presenting at the [AGU Fall Meeting](https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting). We will later be conducting a meta-study on this workshop and our cumulative findings.

For those who are just getting started with contributing to Exoplanet Watch, we've posted resources in [Getting Started](/getting-started/). We've posted several of our [meeting recordings and slides](/meetings/) in case you would like to review them.

Previously, we held our large group meetings on Wednesdays at 1pm PDT in [Zoom](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/2940180841){:target="_blank"} but later switched over to smaller group meetings for individual teams to focus on their research. Signups are closed, but stay tuned for a new iteration of the workshop.

**Questions?** Feel free to join the [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/exoplanetrese-nug2480/shared_invite/zt-d63jj8jl-WFWgC0P9mOBvDLbJEvo5EQ){:target="_blank"} or [contact us](/contact/).

## Leaderboard

We have transitioned to using the newer version of EXOTIC, and the Colab notebook we originally used to synchronize with the leaderboard does not work with this version. Here is a snapshot of the top 20 from our leaderboard from before the version was released. Thanks all for your participation!

## Latest Update (June 13, 2020)

For groups that are writing papers, please continue writing (more guidelines are [here](/papers/)). We're excited to see what you produce!

If your group is not writing a paper, please continue running your transits on different comparison stars. We'll give your transits to a paper writing group, and you will be acknowledged in their paper. For more details, see the [document of tasks for all groups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bl8x1cWRS_cJc2oFljb9NaK1Ps5YVv3XcK7tgvh97UQ/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

Please feel free to reach out to your point person for any guidance you need. We encourage you to schedule small group meetings to discuss the project and work on tasks within your groups.

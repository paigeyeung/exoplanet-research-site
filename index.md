## Latest Update (May 25, 2020)

We know that it is a busy time of year for many of you, so normal meetings will resume on **5/27**. Good luck on exams and any other assignments/commitments you may have during this time!

If you would still like to work on tasks, the document of tasks for all groups is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bl8x1cWRS_cJc2oFljb9NaK1Ps5YVv3XcK7tgvh97UQ/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. If your group is writing a paper, feel free to get started on it whenever you are ready, and reach out to your point person for any guidance you need. More information on writing papers is [here](/papers/).

We encourage you to schedule small group meetings to discuss the project and work on tasks within your groups. If you need help getting set up, please let us know.

## Latest Update (October 12, 2020)

For groups that are writing papers, the paper guidelines can be found [here](/papers/). When you have completed your draft, it will be reviewed by your point person and Kalee (in that order) before it is sent to astronomers. The first papers from this workshop will be coming out soon!

The notebook that is updated to reflect new updates as of 8/22 can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TYBNFgOCijvLEFO4qn_ECy-fv6d9RvC9){:target="_blank"}. You can clone an old version of [this repository](https://github.com/rzellem/exotic) using Git (tutorial [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12256137/cloning-an-older-version-of-github-repo), or feel free to message Paige for assistance). The [transit submission notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C4n-FMeb9v675ScZnBa_dQZpzGlxMbBb?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} for the 8/22 version of EXOTIC is here.

You can also try running EXOTIC locally if you are still running transits or would like to rerun any transits you've run before. If you run the latest version of EXOTIC on your device, it should run much faster now.

As always, please feel free to reach out to your point person for any guidance you need. We encourage you to schedule small group meetings to discuss the project and work on tasks within your groups.

## The Workshop

The Exoplanet Research Workshop is a group-led project intended to bring the [astronomy research seminar](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AAS...23212207G/abstract){:target="_blank"} experience to a larger population of (primarily) high school students. Recently, we've spoken about the workshop at the [Global Hands-On Universe Conference](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=949654105549090&t=1720){:target="_blank"}, and we will be conducting a meta-study on this workshop and our cumulative findings. Previously, we met on Wednesdays at 1pm PDT in [Zoom](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/2940180841){:target="_blank"}. Signups are closed, but stay tuned for a new iteration of the workshop.

For those who are just getting started and are looking for instructions, see [Getting Started](/getting-started/).

We've posted our [meeting recordings and slides](/meetings/) in case you missed a meeting or just want to review the recording.

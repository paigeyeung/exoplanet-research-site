## Latest Update (August 20, 2020)

The Colab has been updated to reflect new EXOTIC updates. The notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TYBNFgOCijvLEFO4qn_ECy-fv6d9RvC9){:target="_blank"}.

The notebook for the old version of EXOTIC is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15zXPTbcYrVTE2xwtq7kdTKHdPq2CKoOO?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. It clones an old version of EXOTIC, so you can still run it if you'd like, but keep in mind that it takes much longer to run than the new Colab because it requires Astrometry.net to platesolve.

For groups that are writing papers, the paper guidelines can be found [here](/papers/).

Please feel free to reach out to your point person for any guidance you need. We encourage you to schedule small group meetings to discuss the project and work on tasks within your groups.

## The Workshop

The Exoplanet Research Workshop is a group-led project intended to bring the [astronomy research seminar](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AAS...23212207G/abstract){:target="_blank"} experience to a larger population of (primarily) high school students. Previously, we met on Wednesdays at 1pm PDT in [Zoom](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/2940180841){:target="_blank"}. Signups are closed, but stay tuned for a new iteration of the workshop.

For those who are just getting started and are looking for instructions, see [Getting Started](/getting-started/).

We've posted our [meeting recordings and slides](/meetings/) in case you missed a meeting or just want to review the recording.

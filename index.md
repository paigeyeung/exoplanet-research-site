# Exoplanet Research Workshop 2021

We are currently running our second iteration of the Exoplanet Research Workshop and welcome new participants on a rolling basis. If you're a pre-college student or early undergraduate interested in contributing to exoplanet research as part of [NASA's Exoplanet Watch](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/about-exoplanet-watch/){:target="_blank"} and possibly writing a paper on your findings, sign up for our mailing list at the link below, and we will get in touch with you soon.

## Latest Update (June 11, 2021)

Our 2021 iteration of the Exoplanet Research Workshop has launched! View our latest meeting recordings [here](/meetings/).

If you have not yet done so, read the [application document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gGFw7xq_9eMRbpl6y2FIfHJqZxXhp9y7tV8SeE9Wasg/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} and fill out this corresponding [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe1ZgWNIE9nW2oHUypMrXkaSSMEqOHjPMd2Vmgjn8O1DvdM0w/viewform){:target="_blank"} to get started, and then you'll be approved to proceed with next steps.

Here are the links to the working versions of the [transit analyzer](http://exoplanetresearch.netlify.app/transitanalyzer){:target="_blank"} and the [transit submission form](http://exoplanetresearch.netlify.app/transitsubmission){:target="_blank"}. We've posted the paper guidelines [here](/papers/). When you have completed your draft, it will be reviewed by your point person and Kalee (in that order) before it is sent to astronomers. The first paper from this workshop has been submitted to the Journal of the AAVSO!

As always, please feel free to reach out to your point person for any guidance you need. We encourage you to schedule small group meetings to discuss the project and work on tasks within your groups.

## The Workshop

The Exoplanet Research Workshop is a group-run project intended to bring the [astronomy research seminar](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AAS...23212207G/abstract){:target="_blank"} experience to a larger population of pre-college students across the globe. Workshop participants contribute research findings to [NASA's Exoplanet Watch](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/about-exoplanet-watch/), a citizen science initative.

We've shared our workshop experiences and citizen science research with the larger space science, citizen science, and science education community at conferences including the [Global Hands-On Universe Conference](https://handsonuniverse.org/ghou2020/){:target="_blank"} (recording [here](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=949654105549090&t=1720){:target="_blank"}) and the [AGU Fall Meeting](https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting). We will later be conducting a meta-study on this workshop and our cumulative findings.

## Getting Involved

For those who are just getting started with contributing to Exoplanet Watch, we've posted resources in [Getting Started](/getting-started/). We've posted several of our [meeting recordings and slides](/meetings/) in case you would like to review them.

In the previous iteration of our workshop, we held large weekly group meetings in Zoom and later switched over to smaller group meetings for individual teams to focus on their research. We will be running a new iteration this spring. Sign up for our 2021 iteration of the workshop [here](https://forms.gle/kpLY8XEyMteNnsPg8){: target="_blank"}, and we will get in touch with more details.

## Leaderboard

*Update: We will be creating a new version of this for our 2021 iteration of the workshop. Stay tuned!*

We have transitioned to using the newer version of EXOTIC, and the Colab notebook we originally used to synchronize with the leaderboard does not work with this version. Here is the leaderboard from before the version was released. Thank you for your participation this year!
